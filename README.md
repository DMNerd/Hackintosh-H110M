# BigSur Hackintosh

This is my personal Hackintosh repo. The main branch is now for BigSur only and will likely not work in near future. If you still want to use Catalina go to its branch.

BigSur works OOB. No new kexts were used (Wifi on this chip still works and works well)

## [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) 

Version: 0.6.5

OpenCanopy bootscreen is enabled and I am using the modern iconset

### What works

* Native Power Management ✅
* Wifi/Bluetooth ✅
* File Vault ✅
* Hardware Acceleration (iGpu in headless mode) ✅
* Apple Services ✅
* Audio over HDMI ✅
* Audio over DP (requires restart after hotplug) ✅

## Kernel Extensions 

My setup does not require many kexts. I built all from source using [Lilu-and-Friends](https://github.com/corpnewt/Lilu-and-Friends). Masive thanks to @corpnewt, you are the boss!

**SMC:** [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)

**Sound:** [AppleALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/applealc/releases)

**Graphics:** [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/lilu/releases) and [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/whatevergreen/releases)

**LAN:** [RealtekRTL8111](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-realtek-network/downloads/) 

## USB

Strictly speaking, these comonents **do not** need USB mapping. You do not get over the arbitrary limit imposed by MacOS. But there are some advantages, like marking the port bluetooth hub is connected to as internal and making sure your usb 3 runs on the maximum speed. 

I used [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool) to generate custom injector kext. This just seemed to work much better for me. 

1. Identifying ports - I have done tho work for you on this board

2. Setting up Hackintool accordingly

3. Export and use the USBPorts.kext

## OS switching through bootcamp

So one of the coolest features to OpenCore in my opinion is the ability to switch OS using native methods such as Bootcamp. 

1. Boot to windows and download CorpNewt's [brigadier](https://github.com/corpnewt/brigadier) 

2. Run the tool. It will download Bootcamp with version native to your SMBIOS - SOME OF THEM USE OLDER VERSION WITHOUT APPFS SUPPORT! In that case do not reboot straight after instalation.

3. Install Bootcamp by double clicking Setup found in the downloaded folder (in the script's location directory). 

4. Run the Apple Update software and let bootcamp update. It appears in the start menu.

5. Restart back to MacOS. You will see BOOTCAMP as option in Startup Disk settings. If it is not there, check that the disk is mounted by MacOS.

I however found problem for people that use second HDD on their Windows. Since Bootcamp was never meant to be run with multiple drives, the setup just sets attributes of every other disk to Hidden. Instructuions on how to fix it can be found [here](https://github.com/DMNerd/Hackintosh/blob/master/Resources/Extra/Bootcamp/BOOTCAMPDRIVEFIX.md)

## Native Power Management

## CFG-Lock

This board does not have the abilitty to disable cfg-lock from bios - meaning it has to be done manually by finding the offset and applying it through the modified grub shell. The process can be found [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html#disabling-cfg-lock). 

## SMBIOS

Closest comparable iMac is [iMac 17.1](https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/?search_keywords=iMac17,1). So that is the SMBIOS we choose. For the platform info we use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS).
